; Example SimConnect client configurations
;
; From MSDEV:
;  The SimConnect.cfg file (which you can get here) contains 
;  communication information for the SimConnect client.
;  This file is only required if a client is going to access 
;  Microsoft Flight Simulator running on a remote machine, 
;  and should be placed in the same folder as the client 
;  application or library, on the computer the client is running on.
