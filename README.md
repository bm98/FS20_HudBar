## Usage 

* Deploy the release zip content in a folder (no installer provided or needed)

Best is to start MSFS first, then the Bar  
<br>
*	Start MSFS2020 first and once the Main Menu is shown
*	Start FS20_HudBar.exe
*	It attempts to connect to the Flight simulator in 5 sec intervals, but shows an error message while it cannot connect
* Note: the shown values are a bit meaningless until the aircraft and flight is live
Also note that the bar is shown on the ++PRIMARY monitor++ at the bottom of the screen
<br>
* Right Click the Bar and choose from the pop up menu
  * To select a Profile (1..5 - your names)
  * To Configure.. to check or uncheck the items to be shown
  * To Exit and stop the program
<br>
*	The Hud can be shown as Bar or Tile 
(to be changed in Configuration, default is Bar at the Bottom of the screen)
    * Bar: a full width window attached to the defined side of the screen
    * Tile: a window sized to accommodate the selected items
A Tile can be moved freely along the side where it is attached to   

Note: the previous Splitter is no longer available â€“ use Tile and move the tile wherever you want.

<br>
Autopilot commands that accept mouse clicks to toggle have a dark blue background and show a hand while hovering the active area  
* AP,HDG,ALT,VS,FLC,NAV and APR can be directly toggled
* BARO set to current (keyboard B button)
<br>
* ETrim - Elevator Trim: clicking the ETrim label will activate the Auto Elevator Trim module for about 20 seconds. 
It will display ETrim in green color while active - clicking the active module again will switch it off   
Note: the module controls the Elevator Trim in a way to level the aircraft towards zero vertical speed.
It may or may not work to your expectation.. so use it only if you feel comfortable with.
<br>
* Calculated fields when a "Next Waypoint" is available:
  * Estimate VS to WYP@ALT (WP-VS):   
  Calculated VS to reach the next Waypoint at the proposed Altitude with the current GS and DIST (ALTP when purple or Setting Alt when blue)
  * Estimate ALT@WYP (WP-ALT):   
  Calculated Altitude at next Waypoint using the actual GS, VS and DIST

### General note for builders
The Project files expect referenced Libraries which have no NuGet package reference in a Solution directory  "Redist"  
To integrate with MSFS2020 SimConnect the solution must be built as x64 binary!   

So far the sources from the used Libraries are not on GitHub (yet)
