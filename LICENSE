MSA (Minimum Save Altitude) data derived from:
https://www.usgs.gov/coastal-changes-and-impacts/gmted2010
https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/topo/globe.html

GMTED2010 max30_grd, 30 arcsec patched with GLOBE elevation data and wrapped with Max value to 1° / 0.5° raster 

To allow for 'safe' altitudes the elevations are extended by 1000 ft rsp 2000 ft in areas above 1500 m and rounded up to 100ft quantities
water bodies (in fact all NoData areas) return 0 ft
